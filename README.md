# ðŸ¦´ Bone Fracture Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify **bone X-ray images** as fractured or healthy.  
It uses deep learning to assist in **medical imaging diagnosis**, potentially helping radiologists detect fractures faster and more accurately.

The model is trained on the [Bone Fracture Dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ahmedashrafahmed/bone-fracture-classification-using-cnn/notebook),  
with preprocessing, augmentation, and CNN architecture tuning for optimal performance.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- Develop an **image classification model** for fracture detection.
- Use **data augmentation** to improve generalization.
- Compare different architectures and evaluate model accuracy.
- Demonstrate deployment-ready ML workflow.
